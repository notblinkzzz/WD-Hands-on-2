## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project is about creating numerous different styles of hero pages with cards, that includes static and animated cards. The purpose of this Project is to learn the things about how to create unique kinds of hero pages and cards.

Some of the key components of my websites are the 3D effects. I used perspective to create a 3D effect on the Title of my 5th design. I also used keyframes for the animations on the flickering effects of my 3rd design and for some reason, its jittery on Google Chrome but smooth on Microsoft Edge, and Opera GX, and I combined it with a neon color and shadow.

The technologies that I used were HTML and CSS. I used HTML for the contents and structure of the website and CSS to design the contents in order for it to look good.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
